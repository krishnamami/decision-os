## What this is

Decision OS is a platform for structured, governed, AI-augmented decisioning.
Any business brings their domain, maps their decisions (independent and dependent),
connects their data sources, and the platform builds context, evaluates policy,
runs AI agents, enforces governance, and produces a complete explainable trace
for every decision made.

Every decision has an owner, a boundary, a mode, and a trace.
No decision is a black box. No action happens without a policy. No context is untracked.

## Key architectural decisions (locked)

```
Atomic tool pattern
  context_build + policy_check + decision bundled into one tool call per agent.
  LLM reasons within boundaries. Code enforces hard rules. Cannot be called separately.

Reflection loop
  Every human override → AgentLearning record → fed back to same agent next similar event.
  System improves without model retraining.

WorkJournalEntry trace
  Not a log. A structured work journal:
  hypothesis_tested | signals_evaluated | contradictions_found |
  conclusion | confidence_basis | human_readable_summary
  Independent critic reviews medium+ risk before execution.
  SelfReviewError blocks agent from critiquing its own output.

context_window_days
  Each decision loads only history within its defined window.
  Prevents context contamination from irrelevant history.
  Defined per decision in decisions.yaml.

Contamination guard
  Dependent decisions refuse to run if upstream confidence is below threshold
  or any upstream decision is blocked.
  upstream_block_propagates_to_dependents is a hard rule.

WHO vs WHAT-NOW (ontology)
  Applicant = WHO — persists across time and applications.
  Application = WHAT THEY ARE ASKING FOR NOW — lifecycle-bound, new each request.
  CreditProfile, IncomeProfile, FraudProfile → belong to Applicant.
  DTI, LTV, product eligibility, underwriting → belong to Application.
  Re-application: same Applicant, new Application, fresh decisions,
  Applicant profiles carried forward within retention window.

Shared-vs-scoped writes in the context store
  Two write conventions live side-by-side in LendingContextStore:
    1. Entity records (Applicant, Application, Property, Loan, CreditProfile,
       IncomeProfile, FraudProfile, ComplianceRecord) → write to the SHARED
       scope, i.e. lineage.decision_id = None. Snapshot reads them via the
       shared scope so every decision sees the same world.
    2. Decision outputs → write under entity_type = "decision",
       entity_id = f"{application_id}:{decision_id}", and
       lineage.decision_id = decision_id. Snapshot reads these via
       upstream_decision_ids so a dependent decision pulls only its
       declared upstream outputs (no peeking at sibling decisions).
  Use DecisionScopedStore.set() only for decision outputs, not entities.
  See core/context_store/lending.py:snapshot() for the read paths.

Connector layering — push vs pull (STEP 4 design)
  One canonical event vocabulary lives in core/normalizer/models.py — the
  interlingua every source converges on. core/connectors/ holds N adapters,
  one per source, each doing source-specific parsing. Adapters split into
  two base classes:

    PushConnector   — source initiates, we react.
                      Examples: borrower portal webhooks, e-sign callbacks,
                                payroll provider events, file drops.
                      Method: listen() — long-running consumer.

    PullConnector   — we initiate, source responds.
                      Examples: bureau pulls (Experian/TransUnion/Equifax),
                                Plaid/Argyle income, AVM lookups, title search,
                                The Work Number.
                      Methods: fetch(query) → BaseEvent, poll(schedule).

  Both feed normalize_event(raw_dict) → typed BaseEvent → context store.
  The normalizer is source-agnostic; only the adapter knows the source's
  shape and request semantics.

  Pull patterns need request↔response correlation. STEP 4 adds:
    BaseEvent.correlation_id : Optional[UUID]   # links request → response
    BaseEvent.request_id     : Optional[UUID]   # the outbound call id

  Simulation strategy:
    Push sources → JSON/CSV fixtures in domains/lending/seed_events/ replayed
                   through the adapter's emit() path.
    Pull sources → recorded response fixtures + a mock HTTP server (respx /
                   vcrpy / a stub) so "Experian returned this XML for X" is
                   deterministic across runs. Each PullConnector ships a
                   MockClient variant for tests.

**Resume command (session expired — start fresh):**
```
/c/Users/bkgou/AppData/Roaming/npm/claude
```

- Ontology deepened — WHO vs WHAT-NOW distinction formalised
- Entity relationship map completed (Applicant → Application semantic links)
- Business entity storage model documented (Redis TTLs per entity)
- CONTEXT.md corrected — removed inaccurate build status

**No new code committed this session.**

---

### Session 3 — May 1 2026

**What was built (STEP 3 of the build sequence — context store):**
- `core/context_store/redis_cache.py`
  - `RedisHotCache` (production, via `redis.asyncio`) and `InMemoryHotCache`
    (asyncio-locked dict, same TTL semantics for tests)
  - Records serialize via `ContextRecord.model_dump_json()` so datetimes
    and UUIDs round-trip; both backends round-trip through JSON so model
    drift surfaces in unit tests, not in prod
  - Keys namespaced `context:{entity_type}:{entity_id}:{decision_id}`
    with `_shared` for shared writes — leaky key in one decision can
    never return another decision's bytes
- `core/context_store/postgres_store.py`
  - `PostgresDurableStore` (asyncpg) and `InMemoryDurableStore`
  - Append-only: `insert_record` finds the active row in a transaction,
    sets `superseded_at` + `superseded_by`, inserts the new row at
    `version + 1`
  - `tombstone()` writes a tombstone row that is itself superseded at
    insert, so a single `superseded_at IS NULL` predicate covers active
    reads — no special-casing in get_latest / get_at_time
  - `get_at_time(at)` for point-in-time replay (filters created_at and
    superseded_at against the requested timestamp)
  - JSONB codec installed at connection init so dicts/lists pass through
    asyncpg without manual `json.dumps`
- `core/context_store/schema.sql`
  - `context_records` — partial unique index on the active row,
    version uniqueness per scope, history index DESC, point-in-time
    index, self-FK on the supersession chain
  - `context_snapshots` — UUID array of constituent record_ids so a
    snapshot pins the exact rows the agent saw (replay-safe)
- `core/context_store/context_builder.py`
  - `ContextBuilder.build(application_id, decision_id, resolver)` —
    looks up decision spec, resolves readable object types via
    `decisions_that_read_it`, expands entity keys via caller-supplied
    resolver callback, snapshots the store, projects each entity through
    `ObjectType.to_context_bundle` to drop unauthorized fields
  - Returns typed `ContextBundle` with `upstream_outputs` keyed by
    upstream decision_id, `context_window_days` from the spec, and
    `snapshot_id` for trace replay
- `core/context_store/__init__.py` — re-exports all new public symbols

**Smoke-tested end-to-end with the in-memory backends:**
versioning, supersession chain, hot-cache hit, history ordering,
snapshot, tombstone + cache invalidation, ContextBuilder permission
filtering (verified: `fraud_screening` cannot see `CreditProfile`),
upstream decision output round-trip through the bundle.

**Hard rules backed in this session:**
- `no_context_without_lineage` — schema enforces `lineage JSONB NOT NULL`,
  base.py validates `written_by` and confidence at write time
- `no_agent_without_permissions` — ContextBuilder drops object types not
  in `decisions_that_read_it` and `to_context_bundle()` raises
  `PermissionError` for unauthorized projections

**Still pending (next session):**
1. Populate `requirements.txt` with `pydantic>=2`, `redis>=5`, `asyncpg`,
   `pyyaml`, `fastapi`, `structlog` so a fresh dev can install
2. Populate `docker-compose.yml` for local Redis + Postgres
3. Build STEP 4: `core/connectors/base.py` + mock CSV adapter
4. Build STEP 5: `core/decision_agents/` (base + atomic_tool + mode_router)

---

## How to resume next session

Open Claude Code:
```bash
/c/Users/bkgou/AppData/Roaming/npm/claude
```

Paste this at the `>` prompt:
```
Read these files in this order before doing anything:
1. docs/PRD.md
2. CONTEXT.md
3. domains/lending/decisions.yaml
4. domains/lending/knowledge_base.json

Then verify what actually exists:
  find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.sql" \
    | grep -v .git | grep -v __pycache__ | sort

Do not ask what the project is. Do not ask what was built.
Read the files and know.

STEPS 1, 2, 3 are complete (normalizer, ontology, context_store).
Build next, in this order:
  STEP 4: core/connectors/base.py
          Base connector + mock CSV adapter + one live adapter.
          Emits RawEvent objects only — no entity hydration here.
  STEP 5: core/decision_agents/
          base.py, atomic_tool.py, mode_router.py.
          The atomic_tool is the single bundled call — context_build +
          policy_check + trace_write + mode_route. LLM cannot call
          steps separately.
  STEP 6: core/execution/dag_executor.py
          Walks execution_order from decisions.yaml. Event bus.
          Wakes dependents on record_updated.

Also populate requirements.txt and docker-compose.yml so the
Postgres/Redis backends can run end-to-end (currently only the
in-memory backends are exercised).
```

## Open questions (unresolved)

```
1. First design partner — org type, domain, workflow, volume?
2. Pricing model — per-decision / per-application / platform fee?
3. Single-tenant v1 or multi-tenant v1?
4. Which connectors live at launch vs mock?
5. AI model strategy — hosted API / bring-your-own / self-hosted?
6. Override authority — single approver or dual-control for high-risk decisions?
7. Connector marketplace — build all integrations or open SDK?
8. "Request more evidence" outcome — needed for human bounce-back to upstream personas?
```
